### DNI — for my own comfort and boundaries (Do Not Interact):

- under 16 (no minors, please)
- trauma dumping 
- self-dx / romanticizing disorders 
- disrespecting boundaries 
- manipulative behavior 
-unwanted flirting 
- drama-oriented interaction
- demand for immediate responses
(I may not respond right away, and that's okay)
- unsolicited advice / “fixing” behavior
(especially mental health or personal matters)
- boundary testing / ignoring stated limits.
- guilt-tripping or emotional pressure. 

I value calm, respectful and mutual communication.
